"""classroom50 runner.

Fetched from the teacher's Pages site by the autograde-runner workflow on
every submission. Reads env, resolves an entrypoint (per-assignment
autograder.py > per-assignment tests.json > classroom-default autograder.py
> vacuous pass), execs it in the student checkout, then reads/synthesizes
result.json + release-body.md + $GITHUB_OUTPUT so downstream steps always
have a v1-shaped payload. Per-assignment grading lives in autograder.py; see
the Advanced-Autograding wiki page.

Exits 0 for EVERY grading outcome, including failures (reported via a
synthetic error result + status=error) so the release/commit-status steps
still fire and the gradebook ingests the submission. Only missing required
identity env (PAGES_BASE_URL, CLASSROOM, ASSIGNMENT, SUBMISSION_TAG) fails
fast with exit 1: those are needed to synthesize a v1 result.json, and
this only happens when run outside the workflow.

Environment (set by the autograde-runner workflow):
  PAGES_BASE_URL    org-level Pages URL of the classroom50 config repo
  CLASSROOM         classroom short-name
  ASSIGNMENT        assignment slug
  SUBMISSION_TAG    submit/<UTC-timestamp>-<short-sha>
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY <owner>/<repo>
  GITHUB_SHA        commit SHA
  GITHUB_SERVER_URL https://github.com (or GHES base)
  GITHUB_ACTOR      fallback username when the repo name doesn't follow
                    <classroom>-<assignment>-<username>
  GITHUB_OUTPUT     workflow-step output sink

Passed through to the entrypoint: USERNAME, COMMIT_URL, RELEASE_URL,
REVIEW_URL (full baseline...graded diff; falls back to COMMIT_URL when
history is unavailable or baseline == commit).

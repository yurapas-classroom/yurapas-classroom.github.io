"""classroom50 Feedback PR maintainer.

Fetched from the teacher's Pages site by the autograde-runner workflow's
"Ensure Feedback PR" step (like runner.py). Lives here (not inline in the
workflow) so the ~160 lines of control flow are unit-testable with a stubbed
`gh`; the workflow step is a thin curl+exec shim.

Opt-in per assignment (the workflow only invokes this when feedback-pr is on
and there's a diff). Maintains ONE long-lived PR per repo:
  base = the frozen `feedback` branch at the baseline commit
  head = the repo's default branch
so the teacher reviews the full starter->latest diff with inline comments, and
it auto-updates on every submission. PRs opened by GITHUB_TOKEN don't retrigger
workflows, so there's no loop.

Since issue #228 the accept clients (gh student accept / the web GUI) create
the PR at accept time with the student's own token (same base/head, title,
labels, and body, byte-mirrored via cli/shared/contract) so it exists even
with Actions disabled. find_pr matches by base+head only, so this script
ADOPTS that PR; this create path remains the fallback for pre-feature repos
and accepts whose best-effort PR step failed.

Behavior (ported verbatim from the former inline bash):
  1. Freeze the base: create the `feedback` branch at BASE_SHA once, never
     advance it. If it already exists at a DIFFERENT sha, a student may have
     pre-created it (ruleset leaves creation open) -> refuse to open/refresh the
     PR against an unverified base, post a failure status, and stop.
  2. Find the single PR (any state). If none, create it (labeled by mode); on a
     create race lost to a concurrent run, re-query and treat the existing PR as
     success. If one exists, reopen only a student's *unmerged* close (a teacher
     merge is the grading-done signal).
  3. Always post a machine-readable `classroom50/feedback-pr` commit status
     (success | failure | error), mirroring `classroom50/autograde`. It defaults
     to `error` and is promoted to `success` only at the verified-good end, so
     an early failure reports error, not false success.

Environment (set by the autograde-runner workflow's grade job):
  GH_TOKEN            token for `gh` (Actions GITHUB_TOKEN)
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY   <owner>/<repo>
  GITHUB_SHA          graded commit SHA (the status target)
  GITHUB_SERVER_URL   https://github.com (or GHES base)
  GITHUB_RUN_ID       for the fallback status target_url
  BASE_SHA            the trusted baseline commit to freeze the base at
  MODE                assignment mode (individual | group), for the PR label
  FEEDBACK_PR_TEMPLATE  "true" when the assignment opts the Feedback PR body
                        into the template repo's pull_request_template.md
  TEMPLATE_REPO         <owner>/<repo> of the assignment's template (for the
                        template-body read; empty when template-less)
  TEMPLATE_BRANCH       the template branch to read the PR-body file from

Exits 0 for every outcome (like runner.py): the status carries success vs
failure vs error. Exits non-zero only on missing required env (invoked outside
the workflow).
